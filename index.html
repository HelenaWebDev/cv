        <p><em>Personal & Business <strong>Coach & Consultant</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a dynamic and multifaceted leader with a legacy of empowering clients by supporting their learning, development & mental health needs. I have a strong foundation in personal and executive coaching in addition to business coaching, personal development consulting, mental health counseling, workforce planning, employee engagement and development, and more. I am enthusiastic about life and wellbeing.<br>
          I hold a bachelor's and master's of social work from the University of Zagreb in Croatia in addition to numerous training and certifications; and I keep my thumb on the pulse of emerging industry trends and best practices. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of serving in numerous key roles including (but not limited to) Social Mentor, Platform Supervisor, and most recently, Platform Shift Leader for 50808, Community Creations.<br>
          I began my journey at 50808, Community Creations in its infancy before it was fully launched in Ireland to help set the foundation for what would become a thriving, multicultural platform that helps countless youths and adults from all around the world who are in crisis.<br>
          At my core is the passion to work in a team framework to investigate, architect, and deliver bespoke solutions that match the needs of the businesses, clients, and teammates I support. I‚Äôm also comfortable challenging and being challenged while building community alliances and interpersonal relations to support employees & clients alike.<br>
          Originally from Croatia, I currently live in Berlin, Germany. I am devoted to utilizing my knowledge and skills to bring the world of coaching closer to people while making a tangible difference and impact in our world.<br>
          When I‚Äôm not busy empowering youths or adults, I enjoy taking long walks, baking, writing and reading. I also enjoy meeting new people - and expanding my personal and professional network. üíñ</p>
